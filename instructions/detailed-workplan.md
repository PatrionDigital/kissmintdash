# KissMint DASH: Detailed Work Plan

## 1. Project Initialization & Environment Setup

- [x] **1.1. Review MiniKit Quickstart Output**
  - Verify that the MiniKit quickstart created the expected project structure and dependencies.
  - Ensure the project runs locally (`yarn dev` or `npm run dev`).

- [x] **1.2. Version Control & CI/CD**
  - Set up GitHub repository if not already done.
  - Configure GitHub Actions for CI (lint, typecheck, tests, build).
  - Add branch protection and PR review rules.

- [x] **1.3. Environment Variables & Secrets**
  - Set up `.env` for local development (API keys, MiniKit project ID, Redis, etc.).
  - Verify environment variables, these will be set up by the `npx create-onchain --mini` command:
  - Document required environment variables in `README.md`.

---

## 7. Backend & Data Management

7.1. **API Design**

- REST or GraphQL endpoints for game sessions, leaderboards, user profiles, token transactions.

  7.2. **Database Models**

- Implement Turso/MongoDB schemas for sessions, users, leaderboards, transactions.

  7.3. **Serverless Functions**

- Deploy API endpoints as Vercel/AWS Lambda functions.
- Integrate with Redis for caching.

  7.4. **Anti-Cheat (Server)**

- Analyze tap patterns, risk scoring, and enforce penalties.

---

## 8. Testing & Quality Assurance

8.1. **Unit & Integration Tests**

- Use Vitest as the primary tool for unit, integration, and component tests.
- Use React Testing Library with Vitest for UI components.
- API endpoint tests with Vitest.

  8.2. **E2E Testing**

- Cypress for gameplay, leaderboard, and purchase flows.

  8.3. **Performance Testing**

- Lighthouse/WebPageTest for tap latency and load times.

  8.4. **Security Testing**

- Input validation, anti-cheat, and token transaction tests.

---

## 9. UX/UI Polish & Accessibility

9.1. **Responsive Design**

- Ensure flawless mobile experience, optimize for one-handed play.

  9.2. **Accessibility**

- Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast.

  9.3. **Animations & Feedback**
