# KissMint DASH: Detailed Work Plan

## 1. Project Initialization & Environment Setup

- [x] **1.1. Review MiniKit Quickstart Output**

  - Verify that the MiniKit quickstart created the expected project structure and dependencies.
  - Ensure the project runs locally (`yarn dev` or `npm run dev`).

- [x] **1.2. Version Control & CI/CD**

  - Set up GitHub repository if not already done.
  - Configure GitHub Actions for CI (lint, typecheck, tests, build).
  - Add branch protection and PR review rules.

- [x] **1.3. Environment Variables & Secrets**
  - Set up `.env` for local development (API keys, MiniKit project ID, Redis, etc.).
  - Verify environment variables, these will be set up by the `npx create-onchain --mini` command:
  - Document required environment variables in `README.md`.
