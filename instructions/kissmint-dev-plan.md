# KissMint Game Development Plan

## Core Game Overview

**Game Name:** KissMint ($GLICO) Button Tapper  
**Platform:** Farcaster Mini App  
**Concept:** Players press a button as many times as possible in 25 seconds, competing for the highest score on the leaderboard.

## Game Mechanics

### Basic Gameplay
- 25-second rapid button-tapping challenge
- Players choose which score to record to the leaderboard
- Free attempts refresh twice daily (9am and 9pm Tokyo time)
- Additional attempts available through $GLICO purchases

### Token Integration
- Initial $GLICO airdrop to engaged users in target Farcaster channels
- Diminishing returns purchase model:
  - First extra attempt: 50 $GLICO
  - Second extra attempt: 100 $GLICO
  - Third extra attempt: 200 $GLICO
  - Fourth+ attempt: 400 $GLICO each

### Reward Structure
- Weekly prize pool from attempt purchases
- Top 3 daily scores receive largest share of rewards
- 20% of prize pool distributed to all active players (minimum 5 attempts weekly)
- Consecutive play streaks reward system
- Sharing rewards for Farcaster frame posts

### Dynamic Pricing
- Discounted attempts near leaderboard reset
- "Happy hour" periods with reduced prices
- Position-based discounts for players outside top 50%

## Development Phases

- Community reporting tools

#### Technical Tasks:
1. Build event scheduling system
2. Implement game variation mechanics
3. Develop achievement tracking
4. Create social challenge functionality
5. Implement community reporting tools
6. Enhance statistical analysis for anomaly detection

## Anti-Exploitation Implementation

### Client-Side Measures
- Click pattern analysis during gameplay
- Device fingerprinting for multiple account detection
- Performance benchmarking to establish baseline metrics
- Click interval variance tracking
- Integrity hash generation for game submissions

```javascript
// Pattern analysis implementation
function analyzeClickPatterns(clickTimestamps) {
  const intervals = [];
  for (let i = 1; i < clickTimestamps.length; i++) {
    intervals.push(clickTimestamps[i] - clickTimestamps[i-1]);
  }
  
  return {
    avgInterval: average(intervals),
    variance: calculateVariance(intervals),
    distribution: generateDistribution(intervals),
    consistencyScore: calculateConsistency(intervals)
  };
}
```

### Server-Side Verification
- Statistical analysis of game submissions
- Anomaly detection for suspicious scores
- Player performance curve tracking
- Risk scoring system
- Leaderboard verification for top percentile scores

```javascript
// Risk scoring system
function evaluateSubmission(userId, submission) {
  let riskScore = 0;
  
  // Check for physically impossible scores
  if (submission.score > MAX_POSSIBLE) {
    return {valid: false, reason: "IMPOSSIBLE_SCORE"};
  }
  
  // Check for inhuman consistency
  if (submission.metrics.variance < MIN_HUMAN_VARIANCE) {
    riskScore += 0.4;
  }
  
  // Check for suspicious improvement
  const userHistory = getUserHistory(userId);
  if (isAnomalousImprovement(userHistory, submission.score)) {
    riskScore += 0.3;
  }
  
  // Trigger additional verification if needed
  if (riskScore > RISK_THRESHOLD) {
    flagForReview(userId, submission.gameId);
  }
  
  return {valid: true, riskScore};
}
```

### Progressive Enforcement
